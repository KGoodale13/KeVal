COS226 Term project. University of Maine, Fall 2016.

# Requirements: Java version 1.8+ is required.

# Building KeVal:
    Use the `make` command to run the makefile

# Running KeVal:
    Change to the src directory
    Client:
        Use the command `java com.kylegoodale.keval.Main client` to run a client
    Server:
        Use the command `java com.kylegoodale.keval.Main server` to run a server

# Using KeVal:
    To use KeVal first launch a server and client. In the client type `help` to
    view a list of commands. Commands are not case sensitive and arguments are
    separated by spaces. If an argument contains a space character you can surround
    it with "" or  '' to avoid having the argument split into multiple arguments.
